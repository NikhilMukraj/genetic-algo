uses c for speed with python interface
custom neural network architecture

## todo

- [x] make c modules with each type of activation
- [x] test activations
- [x] make c activations hook up into one another
- [x] test layers
- [ ] create nn
- [ ] test nn
- [ ] thread computation
- [ ] test
- [ ] model archetirure with string
- [ ] test
- [ ] create python wrapper
- [ ] rewrite ga from python into c
